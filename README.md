this is a complete learning tutorial for git and git hub

till now i have learned how to add file by using git
commad for add file into the staged environment we will be using command "$ git add".
examples
	git add file.name
	git add --all (TO add all file to the staging area)
	git add -A (shorthand form of --all,this will also add all the file to the staging area)
	git add . (this will also add all the file to the staging area) (just a another short hand form)
