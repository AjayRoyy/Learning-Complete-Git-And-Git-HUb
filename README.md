this is a complete learning tutorial for git and git hub

till now i have learned how to add file by using git
commad for add file into the staged environment we will be using command "$ git add".
examples
	git add file.name
	git add --all (TO add all file to the staging area)
	git add -A (shorthand form of --all,this will also add all the file to the staging area)
	git add . (this will also add all the file to the staging area) (just a another short hand form)


now i am at a stage where i can commit all the files that i added to the staging environment or staging area

commit command example
	git commit file.name
	git commit -m "Enter the message here"

IF we want to commit directly without adding to the staging area or environment we can use this command "-a"
	git commit -a -m "Enter the message here";

If we want to delete a branch after merging with the master branch we can use the command (-d)
	git branch -d BranchNAme
Now we are learing about branches
Basically what are branches?
	Branches are like a new repository,in which we modify the code without effecting the main branch.
	To create a branch we will use the "branch" command
	git branch branchName
	
	To check that the new branch is created we will use the command
	git branch

	To checkout the new created branch we will use te command
	git checkout branchName
	git checkout -b branchName (this will create a branch as checkout it at the same time)

	To switch between the branches and the master we will use the command
	git switch branchName or master
